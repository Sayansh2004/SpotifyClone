# Spotify Web Clone

This is a web clone of Spotify's music player interface. It mimics the layout and design of the Spotify web player, but with static content. The buttons are not functional, and the primary goal of this project is to create a visually responsive design.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **UI Cloning**: The main UI components such as the sidebar, header, and music player are cloned from the original Spotify web player.
- **Custom Scrollbar**: The website includes a custom scrollbar functionality to enhance user experience.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Markup structure for the website.
- **CSS**: Styles used to design the layout and make the website visually appealing.
- **FontAwesome**: Used for icons like play, pause, etc.
- **Google Fonts**: Used for custom fonts to enhance text appearance.
